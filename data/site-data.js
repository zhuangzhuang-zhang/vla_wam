We argue that VLA action generation has a different condition-target structure: the policy is conditioned on rich observations, language, and state, but predicts only a compact, low-dimensional action chunk. Under this asymmetry, strong one-step action generation should not necessarily require the advanced one-step methods developed for image synthesis.",
